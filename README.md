PracticalMachineLearning-PredictionAssignment
=============================================

Final project for the Practical Machine Learning MOOC on Coursera: Using a machine learning algorithm to predict an outcome variable.

This Github directory constitutes this participant's submission of the Final Project for the September 2014 edition of the course. The file ProjectReport.Rmd is the R Markdown file that was used to create the compiled ProjectReport.html page, which displays the results of my analysis. The compiled HTML file can also be rendered at the link below:
