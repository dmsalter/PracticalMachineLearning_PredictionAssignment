PracticalMachineLearning-PredictionAssignment
=============================================

Final project for the Practical Machine Learning MOOC on Coursera: Using a machine learning algorithm to predict an outcome variable.

This Github directory constitutes this participant's submission of the Final Project. The file ProjectReport.Rmd is the R Markdown file that was used to create the compiled ProjectReport.html page with the results of my analysis. That compiled HTML file can also be rendered at the link below:
